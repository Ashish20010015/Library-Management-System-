### **Applying MySQL and Python Skills in Library Management System**  

For my Library Management System, I applied my skills in **Python and MySQL** to develop a structured and efficient database-driven application. The project enables **library administrators and users** to manage books, user accounts, and borrowing activities through a seamless interface.  

#### **1. Database Integration and Management**  
I designed a **relational database** using MySQL, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of information. The `Tables.py` script automates database setup by creating tables like `BookRecord`, `UserRecord`, and `AdminRecord`. To enforce **data integrity**, foreign key relationships were implemented between books and users.  

#### **2. Backend Development with Python**  
Pythonâ€™s `mysql.connector` module was used to establish a connection with the MySQL database. I structured the project into **modular files** (`Book.py`, `User.py`, `Admin.py`, etc.), ensuring **separation of concerns**. Each module performs specific CRUD operations, like inserting, updating, and deleting records.  

#### **3. Secure and Interactive User Authentication**  
In `ProjectLogin.py`, I implemented a **user authentication system** for both **admins and library users**. Admins can manage books and users, while users can search, borrow, and return books. Login attempts were limited to enhance security.  

#### **4. Operations and Automation**  
Through `Operations.py`, I built automated functionalities for **book issuance, returning, and feedback collection**. SQL queries with **parameterized inputs** prevent SQL injection, making the system secure.  

#### **5. User-Friendly Interface**  
The `Mainmenu.py` script provides an interactive menu for users and admins, allowing **easy navigation** through system functionalities.  

This project showcased my ability to apply **database management, backend development, and user authentication** in real-world applications, demonstrating **efficient software design and database handling skills**. ðŸš€
